🌲 **### A Work in Progress ###** 🍃

This GitHub is where I’m collecting web design projects as I make my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 
It’s a mix of small experiments, learning exercises, and creative problem-solving—basically, a snapshot of my journey into web development.

🎯 **### Current Focus ###** 🐠

- Exploring front-end design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Tackling challenges and projects that push my skills further.
- Building a foundation for bigger and more polished works.

📌 **### What’s Next ###** 🎵

This space will evolve as I move on to more ambitious projects and expand my skillset. For now, feel free to look around—there’s more to come. 👀
